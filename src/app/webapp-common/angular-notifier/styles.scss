// NOTIFIER: COMBINED STYLES
//
// This file acts as an index - it imports the core styles as well as all provided themes and types. For performance and maintainability
// reasons, it's probably better include only the files needed within the specific project. Alternatively, it's also possible to only use
// those parts (SASS files) used, or even write the styles completely from scratch.
//
// Technical sidenote:
// We do *NOT* use the partial syntax, and also explicitely write out the file type, so compiling works properly.

// Core
@import "styles/core";

// Themes
@import "styles/themes/theme-material";

// Types
@import "styles/types/type-default";
@import "styles/types/type-error";
@import "styles/types/type-info";
@import "styles/types/type-success";
@import "styles/types/type-warning";
